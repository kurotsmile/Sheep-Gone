**🐑 Sheep Gone – Break Out of Baaa-rison! 🚪**

Ever wondered what would happen if a sheep got tired of farm life and decided to make a *baaa-ld* escape? Well, wonder no more! In **Sheep Gone**, you're not just any sheep — you're **the chosen woolly warrior**, on a mission to break out of the most secure sheep pen ever built!

**🎮 How to Play:**

Guide your fluffy little rebel 🐑 through clever puzzles by hopping onto pressure pads, chewing through hay blocks (yum!), and activating strange and mysterious contraptions that open doors. Your goal? Reach the **Escape Point** and say goodbye to baa-ring life forever!

But it won’t be easy — some doors only open when you're standing in the right spot, or when you trigger a button with your chonky sheep body. You’ll need brainpower, timing, and maybe a little luck (plus a lot of *meh*-mory).

**🌟 Game Features:**

* Cute but slightly confused sheep animations 🐑💫
* Silly sound effects that go “BAAA!” at all the wrong times
* Brain-tickling puzzles that will make you feel like a genius... or a goat
* Fun obstacles like hay mazes, springy pads, and doors that just love to stay shut
* Escape levels that get trickier the further you go — because no one said escaping was easy!

**🎯 Your Mission:**

Escape the sheep pen. Outsmart the farmer. Don’t get stuck in the mud. And most importantly… don’t forget to be adorable while doing it!

So, are you ready to baa your way to freedom? Let’s go — **the gates of destiny (and a whole new pasture)** await! 🌾🐑💨
